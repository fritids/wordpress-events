WordPress Events gives you a simple interface for adding events to your site and displays them in a beautiful calendar with pop up details.

== Description ==

WordPress Events gives you a simple interface for adding events to your site and displays them in a beautiful calendar with pop up details.

Simply add events in an interface you are already used to and display your calendar by adding the shortcode `[calendar]` to any page of post!

New in 0.2 !

Multiple user calendars! Allow individual users to have their own calendar and display different calendars by specifying a user id in the shortcode. For example [calendar user=2] will display the calendar for the user with an ID of 2.

Built in sharing generates tiny urls that when linked to opens the shared event in a pop up just as if the user had clicked on it.

Google maps integration allows you to add a map of the venue.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add your first event by clicking on `Events` -> `Add New Event`.
4. Display your events in a page by adding the shortcode `[calendar]` to any page or post. This will display all events from all users.
